# PuzzleTime
# You’ve stumbled upon an alien development server that’s executing a bizarre program in an infinite loop. Every second, it generates a random snippet of Python code and runs it. Your task is to hijack the loop, insert your code into the execution flow, and stop the madness.

# Your Goal: Hijack the loop to execute your own malicious code. The ultimate objective? Shut it down by overriding alien_loop itself and print "Game over."

# Rules: You can insert exactly one line of code into the existing program. No direct modifications to alien_loop are allowed (beyond that one line). You have no idea what code is running at any given time (you only know the function exists).
